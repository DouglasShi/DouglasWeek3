# Douglas Week3
For my midterm project, I am planning on creating a personal blog. I am an individual who loves observing, whether it be traveling to different places to gain a variety of perspectives, or simply sitting in a park to watch people and animals. During these observations, I often come up with interesting insights and thoughts that I want to document. By having my own personal blog website, I can keep track of my daily musings, observations, and realizations. Additionally, I can share this website with friends and family members, allowing them to gain a better understanding of me through my writing.

The technical setup of my website will include an intro page and an about page, where viewers can understand the purpose and significance of the website. There will also be a menu where audiences can view the titles and dates of my daily reflections. If they find a topic they are interested in, they can click on the title, which will redirect them to a page displaying the full content of the reflection. Finally, there will be a page introducing my background and personal information.
